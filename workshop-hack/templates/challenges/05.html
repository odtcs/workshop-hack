    <h1>{{ currentchallenge.name }}</h1>
    <p>This is the fifth challenge. To complete this challenge, the right password should be entered in the field below!
        The system administrator encrypted the password again, however this time he decided to do the decryption server-side.
    He still is not very good with remembering passwords, so he wrote the password down below and put an encoder on the website.</p>
